  <h1>Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Transit-Tracker (“<strong>App</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”). Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy &amp; Cookies Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App, including any data you provide through geolocation, credentials, or other interactions. By accessing or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Geolocation Data</h3>
    <p>When you first load the App, we ask for permission to access your device’s geolocation (latitude, longitude, and, if available, altitude). This information is required to calculate celestial transits (e.g., determining if a flight intersects with the Moon or Sun from your location). We do not store your geolocation data on our servers beyond the immediate request/response needed to compute and display transit results.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Credentials in <code>sessionStorage</code></h3>
    <p>To fetch flight data from third-party providers (OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, AviationStack), you must supply your own API credentials or username/password. These credentials are stored only in your browser’s <code>sessionStorage</code> for the duration of your session. We do not transmit, log, or persist your credentials on any server except to forward them (one-time per request) to the respective third-party API.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Local Storage for Logs</h3>
    <p>All flight-detection logs (timestamps, aircraft callsigns, azimuth, elevation, etc.) are kept locally in your browser’s <code>localStorage</code>. These logs remain on your device and are never transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly choose to download or share them. You can clear your local logs at any time via the “Clear Log” function.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>We use minimal cookies and do not engage in third-party tracking or analytics that identify you personally. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Our App may set a small, session-based cookie to manage user interaction states. These are strictly necessary for the App’s functionality (e.g., remembering which UI tab you selected).</li>
      <li><strong>No Third-Party Analytics:</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any other third-party tracking scripts that collect personally identifiable information. All telemetry is anonymous and aggregated (if any), and no persistent identifiers are stored.</li>
      <li><strong>LocalStorage &amp; SessionStorage:</strong> We rely on <code>localStorage</code> for logs and <code>sessionStorage</code> for your credentials, rather than long-lived cookies. You can clear or disable these storage mechanisms via your browser settings, but doing so may limit App functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Geolocation:</strong> To compute and display real-time celestial transit events (e.g., flights near the Moon or Sun) based on your location.</li>
      <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> To forward your API credentials or username/password to third-party flight data providers (OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, AviationStack) in order to fetch live flight information. Your credentials are never stored beyond the browser session and are not repurposed for any other use.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs:</strong> To maintain a local history of flight transit events you choose to record. These logs are stored exclusively on your device’s <code>localStorage</code> and are never shared unless you manually export them.</li>
      <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> Essential cookies and session-based storage are used to provide and maintain the core features of the App (e.g., automatic refresh countdowns, UI state, and error messages).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties. We also do not use your data for marketing purposes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We integrate with the following third-party services to provide flight information and compute celestial positions. By using our App, you agree to the terms and policies of these providers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SunCalc</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/mourner/suncalc</a>): We use SunCalc’s open-source library (MIT License) to calculate the position of the Sun and Moon. Any modifications or redistributions of SunCalc’s code must include the original MIT license.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenSky Network API</strong> (<a href="https://opensky-network.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://opensky-network.org</a>): To fetch public flight data, we forward your OpenSky credentials (username/password) to the OpenSky API via our proxy endpoint (<code>opensky-proxy.onrender.com</code>). We do not store your credentials or the flight data on our servers. Use of OpenSky data is governed by OpenSky’s Terms of Service, which may impose rate limits or usage restrictions. We cannot guarantee continual uptime of OpenSky services.</li>
      <li><strong>ADS-B Exchange</strong> (<a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.adsbexchange.com/</a>): If you opt to use ADS-B Exchange, you supply your own credentials or API key. We do not persist these credentials, and any retrieved data is used solely to display flight transits in real time. ADS-B Exchange’s Terms of Service apply to all data accessed via their API.</li>
      <li><strong>AviationStack</strong> (<a href="https://aviationstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aviationstack.com/</a>): If you opt to use AviationStack, you provide your own API key. We only send that key once per request to fetch flight data; we do not store it. Any usage or billing is at your own expense, per AviationStack’s Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not share your geolocation or credentials with any party other than these third-party providers on a per-request basis. We do not aggregate or analyze your personal flight data for other purposes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies</h2>

    <h3>4.1 What Are Cookies?</h3>
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device by the websites and applications you visit. They can be used to remember your preferences, login status, or track usage patterns.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Cookies We Use</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Session Cookies (Strictly Necessary):</strong> We use session cookies only to maintain the App’s core functionality—for example, remembering which UI tab you selected or whether you have saved your credentials for this browser session. These cookies expire when you close your browser or clear your session data.</li>
      <li><strong>No Persistent or Third-Party Tracking Cookies:</strong> We do not set any long-term cookies, and we do not use third-party analytics or advertising cookies that track you across the web. All telemetry (if any) is anonymous and aggregated in memory only; we do not persist personally identifiable usage data.</li>
      <li><strong>LocalStorage &amp; SessionStorage:</strong> Instead of long-lived cookies, we use HTML5 <code>localStorage</code> for flight logs and <code>sessionStorage</code> for your credentials. You can clear or disable these storage mechanisms via your browser settings, but doing so may limit certain App features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Managing Cookies</h3>
    <p>If you wish to manage or delete cookies, you can do so through your browser’s settings. Disabling strictly necessary cookies or blocking <code>sessionStorage</code> may prevent the App from functioning properly (e.g., you would need to re-enter your credentials upon each reload and lose automatic refresh states).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using HTTPS/TLS for all data transmissions between your browser and our servers.</li>
      <li>Routing API requests through a simple proxy that does not log or cache your credentials or flight data beyond the immediate response.</li>
      <li>Storing sensitive information (credentials) only in <code>sessionStorage</code>, which is sandboxed to your browser session.</li>
      <li>Never storing geolocation data or flight logs on our servers; these remain in your browser unless you explicitly download or share them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No method of transmission or storage is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for safeguarding any credentials you enter into the App.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Access and Deletion</h3>
    <p>You can review, update, or delete the following data at any time by clearing your browser’s <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Geolocation Permission:</strong> Revoke or deny geolocation in your browser settings to prevent the App from accessing your location.</li>
      <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Clear <code>sessionStorage</code> to remove saved OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, or AviationStack credentials.</li>
      <li><strong>Flight Logs:</strong> Use the “Clear Log” button in the App to delete all locally stored flight-detection history, or manually clear <code>localStorage</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 Opt-Out of Cookies</h3>
    <p>You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or prompt you before a cookie is set. If you block session cookies or disable <code>sessionStorage</code>, the App may not function correctly. To clear existing cookies, consult your browser’s documentation (e.g., Chrome: <em>Settings → Privacy and security → Cookies and other site data</em>).</p>
