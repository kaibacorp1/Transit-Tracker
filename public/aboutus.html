      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I’ve always been obsessed with astrophotography, and back in 2021 I discovered the thrill of flight-transit shots—those magical instants when a plane crosses in front of a celestial body. I would spend hours glued to flight trackers, scanning the skies for any hint of a glinting light heading toward the Sun or hearing a distant plane engine rumble. Every time I sensed a possible transit, I’d dash outside with my camera, hoping to nail the perfect shot.</p>
      <p>That obsession led me to record flight and celestial data long before the app existed. By logging countless hours of flight paths, timestamps, speeds, and positions, I built a solid database to test predictions and validate the trigonometry that drives the app’s accuracy.</p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>My goal is to make transit photography more accessible and rewarding. We combine real-time flight data and precise celestial calculations to predict upcoming transits with a configurable lead time and margin of error. While the app is not 100% perfect—nature and real-world variables always have the final say—it helps you spend less time crunching numbers and more time behind the lens.</p>

      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>From that trove of pre-app data, I distilled the key trigonometric relationships needed to forecast transits. Then, with the help of OpenAI’s o4-mini-high model, I translated those equations into clean, efficient code—no genius required, just a passion for both astronomy and aviation. Every day, I dedicate time to refining the algorithms, improving the UI, and incorporating feedback from our growing community of transit photographers.</p>
