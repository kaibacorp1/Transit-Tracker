  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Data</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Dependencies on Third-Party Providers</h3>
    <p>The App integrates data and/or code from the following third parties. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SunCalc</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/mourner/suncalc</a>) is licensed under the MIT License; any redistribution of its code must include the original MIT license text.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenSky Network API</strong> (<a href="https://opensky-network.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://opensky-network.org</a>) is governed by OpenSky’s Terms of Service. Flight data requests are forwarded through the Author’s proxy endpoint (<code>opensky-proxy.onrender.com</code>). We do not store or cache any flight data beyond the immediate request/response. You must supply valid OpenSky credentials and comply with OpenSky’s rate limits and usage policies.</li>
      <li><strong>ADS-B Exchange</strong> (<a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.adsbexchange.com/</a>) data is subject to ADS-B Exchange’s Terms of Service. You must supply your own ADS-B Exchange credentials. We do not store or redistribute ADS-B Exchange data beyond real-time lookup.</li>
      <li><strong>ADS-B One</strong> (<a href="https://api.adsb.one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://api.adsb.one</a>) data is publicly available and subject to any usage limits published by the project. No API key is required; we retrieve data on-demand and do not cache or redistribute it.</li>
      <li><strong>Browser Geolocation API</strong>: By granting geolocation permission, you consent to share latitude, longitude, and altitude (if available) with our backend solely to compute celestial transits. We do not store or share your location data beyond the immediate, ephemeral transit calculation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4.2 Third-Party Change Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>You acknowledge that any Third-Party provider (OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, ADS-B One, SunCalc) may change its Terms of Service, data formats, rate limits, or availability at any time. The Author is not responsible for any disruptions or policy changes by these providers. It is your responsibility to verify compliance with their current Terms before using the App.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Privacy and User Data</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Location Data</h3>
    <p>To function, the App requests your geographical coordinates via the browser’s Geolocation API. Declining permission will disable certain features. Granted coordinates are transmitted only to compute flight transits and are not stored on any external server.</p>
    <h3>5.2 Credentials</h3>
    <p>Your OpenSky and ADS-B Exchange credentials are stored locally in your browser’s <code>sessionStorage</code>. We do not transmit, log, or store these credentials on our server beyond forwarding them (once per query) to the respective Third-Party API. ADS-B One requires no credentials.</p>
    <h3>5.3 Local Logs</h3>
    <p>All flight-detection logs are stored in your browser’s <code>localStorage</code>. They remain on your device and are never transmitted to the server.</p>
