  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
  <p class="small"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Transit-Tracker! Please read these Terms and Conditions (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) carefully before using the Transit-Tracker application (the “<strong>App</strong>”) operated by Rey Sandu Godakumbura (“<strong>Author</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”). By accessing or using the App (whether via web browser, mobile device, or any other means), you (“<strong>User</strong>,” “<strong>you</strong>,” or “<strong>your</strong>”) agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use the App.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By clicking “I agree,” or by installing, accessing, or using the App in any manner, you expressly acknowledge and agree that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the Author regarding your use of the App and any associated documentation, content, or services.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Eligibility and User Obligations</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Age Requirement</h3>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or older if local law requires a higher age) to use the App. If you are under 18, you agree to use the App only with the involvement and permission of a parent or legal guardian.</p>
    <h3>2.2 Accurate Information</h3>
    <p>You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information when prompted (e.g., valid OpenSky/ADS-B Exchange/AviationStack credentials, correct API keys, and valid geolocation). You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any account credentials you supply or generate.</p>
    <h3>2.3 Prohibited Conduct</h3>
    <p>When using the App, you shall not:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Use the App to collect or harvest personal data of others or to facilitate any other unlawful purpose.</li>

      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the App, or any other systems or networks connected to the App.</li>
      <li>Use bots, scrapers, or automated tools to query our API or the App’s endpoints more frequently than is permitted by the interface (the default polling interval is 5 seconds; any more aggressive polling may result in throttling or termination of your access).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Violation of any of the above may result in immediate suspension or termination of your account and legal action.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. License Grant and Restrictions</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Limited License</h3>
    <p>Subject to your strict compliance with these Terms and any other posted policies, the Author grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the App solely for your personal, non-commercial, informational use. You may use the App to view and calculate celestial transits (e.g., flights intersecting the Moon or Sun) for your personal interest or educational purposes.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Restrictions</h3>
    <p>Except as expressly permitted in these Terms or in the separate LICENSE file, you must not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy, modify, translate, or create derivative works of any part of the App or its source code;</li>
      <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the compiled or obfuscated code contained in the App;</li>
      <li>Redistribute, publish, sublicense, rent, lease, loan, sell, or transfer the App (in whole or in part);</li>
      <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, including trademark or copyright notices, appearing on or in the App;</li>
      <li>Use the App for any commercial or revenue-generating purpose, unless you obtain prior written permission from the Author.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See our separate <strong>LICENSE</strong> file (available at <code>/LICENSE.txt</code>) for full details on permissible use of our code and third-party components.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Data</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Dependencies on Third-Party Providers</h3>
    <p>The App integrates data and/or code from the following third parties. You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SunCalc</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mourner/suncalc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/mourner/suncalc</a>) is licensed under the MIT License; any redistribution of its code must include the original MIT license text.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenSky Network API</strong> (<a href="https://opensky-network.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://opensky-network.org</a>) is governed by OpenSky’s Terms of Service. Flight data requests are forwarded through the Author’s proxy endpoint (<code>opensky-proxy.onrender.com</code>). We do not store or cache any flight data beyond the immediate request/response. You must supply valid OpenSky credentials and comply with OpenSky’s rate limits and usage policies. The Author does not warrant that OpenSky services will remain continuously available; service interruptions or policy changes can occur at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>ADS-B Exchange</strong> (<a href="https://www.adsbexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.adsbexchange.com/</a>) data is subject to ADS-B Exchange’s Terms of Service. You must supply your own ADS-B Exchange credentials. We do not store or redistribute ADS-B Exchange data beyond real-time lookup.</li>
      <li><strong>AviationStack</strong> (<a href="https://aviationstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aviationstack.com/</a>) data is subject to AviationStack’s Terms of Service. You must supply your own valid AviationStack API key. Any usage or billing is solely the User’s responsibility; the App does not collect or store your API key beyond the browser session.</li>
      <li><strong>Browser Geolocation API</strong>: By granting geolocation permission, you consent to share latitude, longitude, and (optionally) altitude with our backend solely to compute celestial transits. We do not store or share your location data beyond the immediate, ephemeral transit calculation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4.2 Third-Party Change Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>You acknowledge that any Third-Party provider (OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, AviationStack, SunCalc) may change its Terms of Service, data formats, rate limits, or availability at any time. The Author is not responsible for any disruptions or policy changes by these providers. It is your responsibility to verify compliance with their current Terms before using the App.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Privacy and User Data</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Location Data</h3>
    <p>To function, the App requests your geographical coordinates via the browser’s Geolocation API. You may decline or revoke permission at any time; however, declining geolocation will disable certain features. If you grant permission, your latitude/longitude/altitude (if available) is transmitted to our backend only to compute flight transits. We do not store this data on any external server beyond the immediate API request/response. We assume no responsibility for any misuse of geolocation data by you or any other party after you grant permission.</p>
    <h3>5.2 Credentials</h3>
    <p>Your OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, and AviationStack credentials are stored locally in your browser’s <code>sessionStorage</code>. We do not transmit, log, or store your credentials on our server beyond forwarding them (only once per query) to the respective Third-Party API. If you close your browser or clear session data, you must re-enter your credentials.</p>
    <h3>5.3 Local Logs</h3>
    <p>All flight-detection logs (timestamp, callsign, azimuth, etc.) are stored in your browser’s <code>localStorage</code>. These logs remain on your device and are never transmitted to the server. You may export or delete your local logs at any time via the “Download log” or “Clear log” functions.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Trademark Restrictions</h3>

      <li>Use automated means (bots, scrapers, scripts) to query or harvest data from the App or any Third-Party APIs faster than the App’s default 5-second polling interval. Any abuse of rate limits is grounds for immediate suspension.</li>
      <li>Resell, sublicense, or commercially exploit any part of the App or its output without prior written permission from the Author.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise derive the source code from any compiled or obfuscated files provided by the App.</li>
    </ul>
