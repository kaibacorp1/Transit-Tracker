Acknowledgments and Third-Party Data/Components:

1. SunCalc  
   • This app uses SunCalc (https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) for computing solar and lunar ephemerides. SunCalc is provided under the MIT License. See the SunCalc repository for full license text.  
   • Any alterations to SunCalc’s code within this project remain subject to the original MIT License, and the original copyright notice must be retained if SunCalc code is redistributed.  
   • All third-party software (SunCalc, etc.) used by this application is included only by reference—SunCalc’s own MIT license text must be retained in any redistribution of its code, whether modified or not.

2. OpenSky Network API  
   • Flight data is retrieved via the OpenSky Network REST API (https://opensky-network.org). Use of OpenSky data is governed by OpenSky’s Terms of Service.  
   • By using this application, you acknowledge that flight data requests are forwarded through the author’s proxy endpoint (opensky-proxy.onrender.com). Neither the author nor this app guarantees continued access to OpenSky’s services; users must provide valid OpenSky credentials and comply with OpenSky rate limits and usage policies.  
   • The author makes no representation that the opensky-proxy.onrender.com endpoint (or any external data source) will be continuously available. Service interruptions, maintenance windows, or API-rate limitations may temporarily render the software partially or completely non-functional. Use this software at your own risk.

3. ADS-B Exchange  
   • An optional mode uses ADS-B Exchange (https://www.adsbexchange.com/) as a data source. ADS-B Exchange data is subject to their Terms of Service.  
   • This app does not store or redistribute ADS-B Exchange data beyond real-time lookup and display. Users must supply their own ADS-B Exchange credentials where required.

4. AviationStack  
   • An optional mode allows queries to AviationStack (https://aviationstack.com/) for flight information. Users must supply their own AviationStack API key.  
   • All AviationStack data usage is subject to AviationStack’s Terms of Service and any applicable billing or rate limits. This application does not collect or store AviationStack API keys beyond the browser session’s local storage.

5. Geolocation  
   • On page load, this app requests the user’s geographical coordinates via the browser’s Geolocation API. By granting permission, the user consents to share latitude, longitude, and altitude (if available) for the sole purpose of computing celestial transits. No location data is stored on any external server beyond what is required to perform the transit calculation at runtime. The author assumes no responsibility for any misuse of geolocation data outside of the intended purpose.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Additional Terms:

6. Third-Party Terms of Service Changes  
   Third-party data providers (OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, AviationStack, etc.) may change their Terms of Service, data formats, or API availability at any time. The author is not responsible for any service disruptions or policy changes by these providers. It is the user’s responsibility to verify compliance with those providers’ current Terms before using the app.

7. Privacy and User Data  
   This application does not collect or store any personal user data beyond what is strictly necessary to perform the flight-detection calculation at runtime. User credentials (OpenSky, ADS-B Exchange, AviationStack) are forwarded only to the respective data provider and are held in browser sessionStorage for the duration of the session. No user-specific flight history or location data is persisted on the server beyond the immediate API request/response.
